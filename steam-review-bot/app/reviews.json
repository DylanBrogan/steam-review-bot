As someone that used to do tournaments and events with a team as a former semi-pro back in the day, this game has steered so far to terrible that it's just not worth wasting time on until it's in a proper playable state. It's a shell of what once was one of the most optimised FPS's out there and many other current pro players and former pro players will tell you the same thing. If you have a ping above 20, forget about it. The glitches, the cheaters, the lack of network utilisation, the lack of support for content creators, the deceit etc.. There's just so much wrong with this game right now. This review may change later, but I'm dead sick of trying to enjoy it as it once was. Perhaps it's my fault for moving over to Starlink, perhaps I'm getting old, or perhaps the years beforehand were my imagination, but no, it's not the case because others have the exact same issues and it seems Valve has turned a blind eye to them.",

            "review": "CS2? More like CSPOO ü§Æ\n\n     CS2 is a terrible direct replacement of CS:GO. It still doesn't have many of the maps and gamemodes that CS:GO had, and it's been a year since it's disastrous release. For the maps, all they'd have to do is port them overrr WTFF. I don't care if the maps still have CS:GO graphics, I and many others just want to play them again. üò≠ The main thing they've been focusing on in the very few updates since release has been further monetization, they barely give a fuck about making the game as good as CS:GO was, even though they killed CS:GO (their masterpiece) to overwrite it with CS2, the very rushed supposed \"newer and better\" version of CS:GO. All they did was make the game prettier, but that barely matters when there is only a few of the maps and gamemodes from before, and the gameplay is worse. AND ALL THE HUNDREDS OF UNIQUE STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS FROM CS:GO ARE GONEEE. ALL THE ONES I SPENT HOURS GRINDING, WTF NEW VALVE. And Valve holding off fixing the bot problem in TF2 that had been plaguing the game for more than five years until finally only a couple months ago when the community made a petition with over 340 thousand people signing it is so shitty, I think they're forgetting they're a game company. Do they even care about their games at this point? If so, barely. I can go on for much longer yapping about their blatant laziness and lack of care for their own games and their respective communities. Screw what Valve has become, MAKE COUNTER-STRIKE GREAT AGAIN.\n     I was actually so hyped for Counter-Strike 2's release, I loved Valve, but then I realized CS2 was dogshit and that Valve doesn't give a fuck about their games anymore. Replacing one of their greatest masterpieces with a massive downgrade in every aspect other than the graphics, smh.\n     CS:GO was what I fell in love with, not whatever this is. My favorite gamemode, Flying Scoutsman... I won't forget you. Great job Valve üëè great job fumbling this shit on a level no one has seen before, except maybe with Overwatch 2. I will never forget the hell of a time I've had playing CS:GO, my favorite FPS game. Thank you Valve for giving me the chance to meet so many other hilarious and goated people playing the game that I loved most. But please, don't forget to think about your community and listen to us. I truly believe CS:GO was better than Valorant, but CS2 is most definitely not. For Christ's sake bring CS:GO back, and if you don't, maybe consider bringing back all the features that CS:GO had before you start adding a ton more paid cosmetics, that's basically all you've done in the past year of updates. Why'd you have to force everyone from CS:GO to switch to CS2, CS:GO was a meticulously crafted game that was still owned by you, so why didn't you let people continue playing CS:GO and just make CS2 it's own separate game? Then people could've continued enjoying CS:GO and feeding you money while you get CS2 in a more acceptable and complete state, worthy enough for more people to then switch over from CS:GO to CS2. You've never directly replaced your games with a sequel like this before, why did you do that now when it's clearly a terribly poor decision. You could've just make CS2 a separate game and when someone unlocks cosmetics in CS:GO, it'd also unlocks them in CS2, and you could have CS2 exclusive cosmetics. Please stop killing your games along with your reputation Valve. Don't just make Counter-Strike great again, make Valve great again. Gotta say, Valve you're killing it with the VR gear and the Steam Deck, but could you please show your games a little more love? They deserve it, and we do too. Love your new \"Major Update\" on November 13th btw, so glad to finally see only one of the many classic maps left behind added back from CS:GO into CS2, what a major update thanks :) Took more than a full year but that's okay. One map returning is such great progress. And thanks for all the community maps as well, I know it's very difficult to re-release all of your own maps, thank god for the community mappers still making some actual content for you to release :D Maybe you should start hiring them again like you used to do way back when? Could help to fix and finish your game you know, just a suggestion. \"We're happy to announce the return of the momentarily lost classic, Train.\" Wow, \"momentarily lost\" is a year in your eyes. Crazy. Valve time sure is real. We gonna start a #FixCS2? Guess it should be more of a #FinishCS2. Come on now, this game is seriously lacking in content, especially when compared to CS:GO, the game you replaced with this shit. Now I'm just repeating myself. Yap session over.",

Valve abandoned this game for years and it got infested with bots, hackers, griefers-harassers and the majority of them got away with what they did, ruined peoples games and wasted their time, and they didnt get banned, punished, witch-hunted and jeered at. Some of them are still out there still doing it and left unpunished.\nValve ban & punish those hackers, bot hosters and griefers.\n\n2. Random Crits, it maybe \"funny\" or \"satisfying\" the first or second time but after that its not, when you get them its not because it wasnt your skill, experience, thinking, performance that got you those kills it was just a cheap kill because of that random mechanic of the game, when you get kill by them its so unfair.\nValve remove random crits from Casual.\n\n3. Menu music, each time you enter the game, music sounds on the menu, in my case i dont want to hear the music everytime i enter the game, Valve put a buttom to deactivate the music so it doesnt sound each time we enter the game.\n\n4. Valve never released neither the Uranium nor the Mirror Botkiller weapons\n\nOperation Oil Spill, Steel Trap, Mecha Engine & Gear Grinder Rewards gives rewards that nobody wants/uses now, it should be added at least 1~2 hats for a tour completed on those Operations,\nplayers only get Rust,Blood,Silver mk1, Gold mk1, Silver mk2, Gold mk2, Carbonado & Diamond botkiller weapons that now, are worth almost nothing and almost noone use them\n\n4. Friendlies\n\n5. Afks\n\nMap Lazarus's visual artifacts in form of square shapes forming a sphere\n\nDemoman's Grenade Launcher does have 6 barrels when the weapon only shoots 4 pills.\nValve change the model and animation for its four pills.\n\nDemoman's LochandLoad grenade launcher, in the past it only had 2 pills and its model was right, but now the weapon has 3 pills to shoot and its model still has the old two barrel gun. Valve please change the model\n\nSome icons like the demoman's should be a stickybomb not a generic bomb, in my opinion\n\nToxic PvP\n\nToxic Mann Up Mode Mann vs Machine \n\nToxic Mann Up Mode Mann vs Machine \"TACOBOT\" thing\n\nRage/Triggerting Bait \"ez, your mom ez\" posters, they arent punished\n\nToxic Taunts, Luaghter & Dancing, dont laught at me\n\nSniper Rifle OP and Snipers Annoying, you must prioritise it as target and kill it fast or neither you or your team cant do a thing, very hard to see on long distances, disrupt the game abruptly\n\nSpy annoying, disrupts the game and the phasing of it\n\nSoldier's \"thanks soldier\" annoying\n\nDemoknight annoying\n\nW+M1 Pyro that comes out of nowhere Annoying\n\nScorch Shot Annoying\n\nFriendlies and \"Friendlies\", one of the worst things\n\nWutville map\n\nHelltrain map, Graveyard map, and other Halloween maps that i dont remember their names right now\n\nUgly Weapon skins, why did you let this happend\n\nUgly Halloween and \"X\"mass cosmetics, why did you let this happend\n---\nProblems with weapons:\n\nThey never released the old weapons like the grenades, Nail Gun, Tranquilizer Gun, etc.\n\nThey never released alot of weapons that were ready to drop like the Afterburner, Assault Cannon, Inside Jab, the Specialist, the Spitfire, etc.\n\nThe Scattergun doesnt have double shot\n\nThe Force-A-Nature doesnt have double shot\n\nThey removed Soda Popper's Minicrits, the weapon is trash now\n\nThey nerfed the Baby Face's Blaster's because it was \"\"\"\"\"\"bugged\"\"\"\"\"\", the weapon is trash now\n\nThey nerfed the Crit-a-Cola, the weapon is trash now\n\nThey removed the Sandman's Stun Effect, the weapon is trash now\n\nThe Sun-on-a-Stick, this weapon is bad since its release\n\nThe Liberty Launcher has no use now\n\nThe Cow Mangler 5000 has no use now\n\nYears have passed and the Gunboats wasn't never given to Demoman, why are you this evil\n\n*sigh* The Righteous Bison, this weapon was cool but OF COURSE they had to remove some of its effect THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND WAS NOT A BUG, and then, they nerfed it even more\n\nThe Equalizer has no use now\n\nThe Manmelter, another cool retrofuturistic weapon that its visuals were bugged since its released and now i dont even know its stats state.\n\nThe Scorch Shot, Annoying weapon that doesnt even do considerable damage its just there to annoy players, those who use this deserve chronic severe pain\n\nThey nerfed the Axtinguisher, the weapon is trash now\n\nThe Sharpened Volcano Fragment, this weapon is bad since its release\n\nThe Hot Hand, this weapon is bad since its release\n\nThe Loch-n-Load doesnt have its third barrel for its third pill, bad\n\nThe Ullapool Caber, another nerfed weapon, it was very fun to use before, the weapon is trash now\n\nThe Eviction Notice has no use now\n\nThe Pomson 6000, another nerfed weapon, has no use now\n\nThe Vita-Saw, ...?\n\nThe Sniper Rile, OP Weapon, Extremely good players with this weapons locksdown the opposing team, hard to deal with\n\nThe Ambassador, unfairly nerfed weapon, this was one of the picks to deal with a Sniper.\n\nThe Enforcer, nerfed weapon\n\nThe Red-Tape Recorder, this weapon is bad since its release\n\n---\n\nGood things about this game?\n\n1.

Even implementing co-op/multiplayer for Noita, along with graphical/QOL mods. I highly recommend this game even if you are on the fence of \"considering buying\". You will be challenged in the best possible ways, and it will feel rewarding when you do progress. Your wand building will only be limited by your imagination, and ultimately your demise. You will die, multiple times too. Probably a similar amount of deaths to souls-likes. I don't play souls-likes, however, I can imagine the difficultly level is similar. Don't let this throw you off though. Anyone can get into this game if you give it a chance. Love the game, incredible community, would attempt win again. \n\nStill 10/10.",

So if you want to really go crazy/fun with your wand build, expect the game to crawl or crash.  That's probably the biggest fun killer for me.

The most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance, which feels more like a step backward than an improvement. Matches are too often decided by glaring AI inconsistencies, making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable. It‚Äôs genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements.\n\nMoreover, it's hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from EA for the game's current state. Community feedback seems disregarded entirely, with players voicing frustrations about bugs, balancing issues, and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed. While cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized, essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected, leaving the core experience in a poor state.\n\nIn its current form, FC 25 feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab, relying on fans‚Äô loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience. For a company as established as EA, it‚Äôs disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard, and the product itself left in such a poor state.",

            "review": "TL;DR - This game is a psychologically manipulative Skinner box. It is designed to be addictive, and to get as much money out of you as possible. Scripting, implemented to encourage FUT players to spend more money, is in every mode and makes every game an unsatisfying and empty experience. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, the income-focused manipulation displayed here is repugnant. \n\nDDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment) or scipting is just ridiculous now. In games against EA's garbage AI, if the game wants your opponent to score, they'll respond to your controller inputs instantly, not the actions of the player you're controlling. Easy tackles with world class defenders will either miss, bounce the ball to another opponent, just outright phase through the ball or even the damn player! Your keeper will do a Matrix-esque dodge of a shot coming directly at them or will spill an easy catch directly into their striker. The most outrageous though, is player switching on loose balls and when contesting headers. The game will sometimes prevent you from switching to a player (even manually with the right stick) if they're close enough to win a loose ball or are in the best position to win a header. They will instead just stand there, staring blankly into the distance, until the opponent wins back possession. It's the most obvious example of the game cheating to achieve the outcome it wants. This stuff is so obvious that I've been able to predict when a goal is coming, just by how many advantages the AI gets. \n\nOther examples:\n- 30 year old fullback with 60 pace will gain an otherworldly burst of speed to get ahead of my winger with 90 pace\n- Players will frequently and deliberately place themselves in a position to lose headers, even if you're instructing them to do the opposite\n- Opposition defenders will basically teleport to tackle you the second you press shoot in the box\n- Your passes will frequently go to a player in the complete opposite direction to the one you've commanded\n- Uncontrolled defenders will randomly clatter someone in the box, giving away a penalty\n- Some of the AI's most outrageous Sunday league fouls just won't be given \n- If the game doesn't want you to score anymore (or has the scoreline it wants to achieve), the opposition will just pass the ball around the back or run all the way back to the keeper upon any pressure. This would be fine if they weren't 2-1 down at 70', where any team would be pushing hard for an equaliser. Again, just breaks the immersion.\n- If the game wants you to score, all of these advantages are removed and opposing players lose 50 IQ points. It's ridiculously transparent. \n\nThese problems extend to all other game modes, especially Ultimate Team. \n\nAt the end of the day, all this does is damage the experience. Wins don't feel earned, since it's obvious that the game is allowing you to win. When you lose it's often because of the above advantages, not from been legitimately outplayed. For a game that aims to recreate football, it fails spectacularly in presenting the core part of that experience; the in-match gameplay. Neglecting this, by adding a scripting or variable difficulty system to psychologically manipulate FUT players to spend more money, not only irrevocably destroys the experience in all modes, but is also outrageously anti-consumer. I knew on reputation that EA Sports games were microtransaction ridden hellholes but this is predatory to a degree I've never seen before. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, manipulation like this is repugnant. Honestly, I feel dirty having spent money on this. \n\nDo not buy this or any other EA Sports Skinner box, it's a prime example of everything wrong with this heinous company.",

I really like how tactics seem to matter more now than what they might have done in previous titles.\nThere are quite a few new features that I appreciate, such as the improved youth academy that allows you to play youth tournaments with them, although I wish it had a bit more \"depth\" to it. The social media feature is nice, but really it's just sort of a remake of the news feed you'd get in the previous games. The gameplay seems more akin to the sort of football you'd see being played in real life which I find quite nice.\nI really wish EA would add the ability to view results from past seasons (all of the leagues, top goalscorers etc.). Also the constant copy paste cutscenes get old really quick, there definitely needs to be more variety with them. I would also like for them to bring more customization abilities for your custom stadiums.\nI think there also needs to be a purpose for earning money as a manager, because you do get a salary, but there is absolutely nothing you can do with it.\nRegardless though, I can recommend this game for those who like football and feel like managing their own club is something they want to do.",

Sorry you can't as there are no 433 formations with this midfield combination\nIf you want to make an asymmetric formation (like having a LW with a RM)? Sorry you can't as the preset formations provided are all symmetric and standard formations\nIf you want to make adjustments during a match? Sorry you can't adjust the position of players (player positions cannot be adjusted (like making a CM to CAM when you are losing), only the very limited attacking instructions and overall formation can be changed\nIf your defence is under great pressure? Sorry your LM/RM/CM/CAM won't help the defence and will stand still and watch the ball on the midfield as the IQ thinks the jobs of the midfield players are only for the midfield (no options on defending behaviours)\nIf you are having a clear and potential chance of one-on-one opportunity? Sorry even if your CAM/CM is next to you, he may stand still as he belongs to the midfield)\nInconsistent gameplay and possible scripting (I play 10 min half time, and I have experienced this frequently - during a match if I score, then the speed of the player movement and the ball, as well as the action of every player will be boosted suddenly, and my sliders will no longer apply, and the AI will pass the ball very quickly and score easily as your defenders will just stand still without tracing the attackers and your GK will just dive on the ground without saving it even it should be a easy save)\nUnfair game with the AI\nWhen the AI defends. for many teams, their midfielders and defenders will have a very compact defence shape (they may even get speed boost when they tackle you) But for your own team, only defenders are defending, even sometimes they just stand still and watch the ball (For attacking it is in similar scenario) (Kind of intentional design by the game)\nIt is also easy to end up with abusing one-two through pass/dribbling as your players won't move(strikers frequently end up in stupid positions of the box like moving slowly far behind you/do't appear in empty space)\nI have also experienced a lot of bugs/crashes/screen freezes, especially in half time/between the end of a match and the start of the press conference that I cannot do anything but close the game directly and lose all the progress (I have no problems playing other AAA games in high settings)\nDisclaimer: I have tried and applied no sliders/preset in-game sliders provided and many popular sliders provided by online communities, and I have only played career mode games in legendary difficulty (I heard that world class might provide a more realistic experience but it is too easy for me to win), so what you might experience can be different\nFC IQ tactics is a good try/starting point in my opinion but too far from finished product which mimics realistic tactics in real life football",

            "review": "I can‚Äôt even comprehend how bad a video game can be, so here are my thoughts (mostly about Ultimate Team) as a pros/cons list.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Nontent every day; I can‚Äôt remember the last time they added a quality SBC that wasn‚Äôt either overpriced or just down right bad.\n- \"Microtransactions\" - packs cost ‚Ç¨15-25 each; with new packs added daily, I assume that's what they call ‚Äúcontent.‚Äù\n- There‚Äôs always at least one AFK player in rush games, since it‚Äôs the quickest way to complete evolutions. You can‚Äôt do anything about it, so you just carry on, struggling against tryhards on the opposing team. I wonder if they‚Äôll ever add an option to kick AFK players.\n- There was no option to mute the commentator in Rush mode until they finally added it in a recent patch.\n- CPU defense is too strong. You‚Äôll end up passing the ball around for 10-15 minutes, hoping your opponent will get impatient and rush their defender so you can finally score. The same issue exists in Squad Battles‚Äîsometimes, you‚Äôll easily win on Legendary difficulty, while other times you‚Äôll struggle to score and lose.\n- \"Nonexistent\" DDA - Even if your opponent is down 0-5 at halftime, they still have a high chance of making a comeback. EA, of course, claims there‚Äôs no such thing as Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA).\n- Player intelligence is poor; 80% of passes go off-target, so you end up losing possession. The defensive and attacking AI is lacking as well.\n- The game demands a huge time commitment. For better rewards, you‚Äôll need to play 44 games a week (12 in Division Rivals, 15 in FUT Champions, 12 in Squad Battles, and 5 qualifiers), each lasting around 10 minutes. That‚Äôs 7 hours a week, which isn‚Äôt terrible, but realistically you‚Äôd need to play 20-25 games to achieve 12 wins in Division Rivals. While the rewards are better, they‚Äôre still not worth the time, which seems intended to push players toward store packs.\n- Many players do nothing but spam skill moves such as fake shots and roulettes, repeatedly losing possession. It‚Äôs repetitive and frustrating.\n- Running to the edge of the field, cutting back, and scoring is easy because the goalkeeper‚Äôs AI doesn‚Äôt react well.\n- The game crashes often after redeeming an SBC.\n- After every game, there‚Äôs a popup showing objective completion‚Äîeven when nothing was actually completed.\n- Sometimes, the playstyle+ icon turns into large white triangles covering the screen, which requires you to restart the game for them to disappear.\n- Inviting friends to a lobby is unreliable, as the overlay button frequently disappears, forcing you to restart the game.\n- Draft  hasn‚Äôt been updated in eight years, and they haven‚Äôt even adjusted offline match length to match that with Squad Battles.\n- Lack of highly advertised cosmetic evos.\n\nPROS:\n- You can create good-looking players in Clubs mode.\n- Manager mode is relatively well-rounded and enjoyable.\n- Roles+ and Roles++ \n- Most Ultimate Team modes have updated rewards\n\nSUMMARY:\nWhile the gameplay feels smoother than in FC24, the experience remains disappointing, especially with the push for microtransactions. Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend buying the game or spending money on packs.",

            "review": "Hello everyone, I hope I can help you in your purchase by sharing my experiences with this game. Let me put your mind at ease from the beginning. FC 25 is like a DLC for FC 24. The gameplay is almost a copy of the gameplay of FC 24, but nothing has changed.  What has been added to the game is the new tactics for the teams. Let's skip the gameplay. FC 25 is not a fair game in the ultimate team section, and you do not play in the same situation as your opponents, and your team and conditions may be much worse or better.  It is from your opponent and there is no guarantee that you can have a strong team without spending money. In terms of optimizing the game, it is in a good condition so that you can get 120 frames with the right graphics settings, but I am from some of my friends who have graphics cards like  They have 3060. I heard that the game has optimization problems, but I am not sure about this. In short, if I want to say, this game is not worth 70 dollars, and it is much better to buy this title at a discount.  And follow the news of the day, it can involve you for tens of hours or hundreds of hours, but before that, you should realize that you do not have the same conditions as your opponents and many other things that I mentioned in the above text in general.  If you are not a fan of ultimate team, I don't recommend FC25. If you wait for this title to be released on ea play, it is worth much more than spending 70 dollars.  I hope I was able to help you make a better purchase.",

You can't play as a player in Franchise mode anymore. What to play as a player? The only option is Superstar mode.\n2. Superstar is a grind like 2K basketball's player mode. If you don't buy booster, you can't even finish the first batch of quests.\n3. Again Superstar mode, you can't customize the player. The archetype dictates your player's potential. Utterly nonsense.\n4. Your CFB player has ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT on the Superstar mode, despite it's marketed that the player \"will carry over, including the player history\". No, you start the mode as if the player is the generic default player except one mention of one award my player had won in CFB 25.\n5. You can't even customize game sliders and team rosters in Superstar mode because  they want you to GRIND.\n6. You start with 60ish overall rating for a QB, regardless of your record in CFB 25 and in the Combine, because they want you to GRIND.\n7. Magically the mode traded my team's starting QB away (Justin Herbert to Rams LMAO) just so that it can start me. Immersion breaking.\n8. It's insulting that they even got Tyreek Hill to record a video telling you to GRIND.\n9, Constant server disconnects that will FORCE you out of an ongoing SOLO match. Can you believe this sh*t?\n\nThe funniest part is the Superstar mode is online only. The server will shutdown in a few years, which means your grinding will be gone, your time and money wasted and you won't even have a player mode.\n\nI have played Madden 20, 22 and 23. 25 is absolutely a step backward except for revamped graphics, which looks kind of weird anyway.\n\nDon't buy. Don't encourage EA. Save 50+ GBs on your hard drive.\n\n P.S.: Again EA tried some DEI sh*t in this game. For CFB25, they put unrealistically high amount of non-white cheer-leading population, and the cheerleaders are simply ugly. I could live with that because it wasn't part of the gameplay.\n\nBut with Madden 25, they put a terrible girl announcer. It's part of the core gameplay. She is just terrible. NFL occasionally has female announcers and they are decent and relatively rare. Forcing a half-good announcer into the game just because she is female is just unbearable.",

Great to have a band of characters I can enjoy and a story that has logical telling and backup for it.\n\nBlacks Ops 6 Zombies: Actually the best since BO2. Love playing it and probably will play this the most out of anything. Love the grind; round based zombies is great with the optional Easter eggs that is enjoyable to do.\n\nBlacks Ops 6 Multiplayer: Dear fucking god no. I won't touch this anymore. I can't seem to find the logic behind making SBMM in regular multiplayer. I don't have the time to grind 9 hours a day like the sweats do on here. If I dare have one good match; the entire evening is ruined by being placed into match after match of no job lifeless sweats who don't do anything but nut as much as possible over their keyboard and mouse while listening to \"RING RING OF THE FIRE\" music morning and night.\n\nBO6 MP Cont.: Not to mention the 'Skill Based Damage'. Yes it is real. Yes it is game ruining. Yes it is stupid. I love going 24/6 in a match then mid-match it changes, taking 7-10 rounds to kill a person. Before finishing the game at 28/39. Because none of my bullets are dealing the same dmg that they did in the beginning. It makes MP entirely unplayable because you're not even allowed to be decent at the game. If you're shit at the game, boom you get to deal more dmg than those better than you. This is the most outrageously stupid thing they have ever implemented.\n\nVerdict: Yes. 2/3rds of the game is great, but MP with SBMM and SBD becomming the norm.

            "review": "This game is the most fun I've had on a Call of Duty game since Black Ops 3. So before I critique anything, I'll comment on the good parts of the game:\n\nZombies - The most time I've spent on the game has been on zombies. It's a blast with Terminus having it's main quest and exploring the map and finding your areas to play at. Liberty Falls is the much MUCH easier map recommended for the people just getting into the Black Ops 6 Zombies feature or are returning after not playing any of the newer games. Very spacious, and great for doing a lot of Dark Ops Challenges. The Elite enemy on Liberty Falls is much easier to defeat than the Elite on the Terminus map, but are both difficult to some degree. \n\nGuns - The guns all feel amazing to use on their own accord, From base weapons to using elementals, and Pack-A-Punch; They all just feel really good and make the game feel good in every mode. \n\nCampaign - One of the best campaigns I've seen of most Call of Duty campaigns. Starting with picking up from Cold War, coming to a solid end. Loved the Easter Eggs and References.\n\nMultiplayer - The mode I've spent the least amount of time with the game on; This mode could be improved more, but from what  I've seen since the beta it's improved with more guns to use, and new maps being released the mode is slowly improving more and more; which is appreciated by the community/\n\n\nHere are some critiques/issues I do have with the game:\n\nZombies:\n\nThe Points System - This system was changed from the older games going from receiving points for every bullet hit on a zombie where you could be trading in weapons for more points, or trading in points for more hard hitting weapons to every weapon makes the same amount of points regardless of headshots or basic kills. Point balances with this on zombies would make it a much more fun experience.\n\nElites and Specials - The Elites (Abominations, Amalgams) & Specials (Manglers) aren't typically too difficult in the game, but it changes drastically when you hit a certain amount of rounds. Multiple Elites and Specials spawn in one round making the game much harder than the round you're on should be. The spawn rates of these enemies also aren't balanced to a team size difficulty; so if you're playing alone to a certain round you can encounter the same amount as you would with a full team.\n\n\nCampaign:\n\nOnline Only on a single-player mode - So as anyone reading this knows, campaign is typically single-player, which should be set as an offline feature. It's not. Playing in the middle of the game, or when you're about to hit the end of something difficult without a save point you can be taken out of the game by losing even a slight bit of your WiFi connection and restart from the last checkpoint. \n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nNo Ranked Mode - Currently the game doesn't offer a ranked mode which makes sense as the game had just been released, but there's also the issue of skill-based matchmaking where if you play even decently for a single match or a few matches you'll be put up against players that have higher skill compared to you or to a player that's coming in as a new player. Putting a ranked mode would give players the option to play against others with their own skill, or a mix of everyone but would also decrease the amount of heavily skilled players compared to others just trying to enjoy the game.\n\nMap Spawns - This is something that's always been an issue in every Call of Duty game, but with how the maps are laid out the spawns are put in places where if someone spawns in they can get spawn killed over and over again, not giving them a chance to play through the match, or they'd run out of their spawn and get killed immediately.\n\n\nOther than these issues, I would personally recommend playing Black Ops 6, but I'd also like to recommend it if you have decent WiFi at least, since it is an Online Only game for some wild reason. If you are going to give this game a try, I'd say try it on an Xbox Game Pass trial, or play it on a friend's computer/console to see if you like it first. Since this game just came out and has issues like the ones listed above and much more, it's a big hit or miss whether you'd like it or not.",

            "review": "It‚Äôs been a while since I bought a Call of Duty game, and it‚Äôs been even longer since I actually enjoyed and played it. The last game I really enjoyed and played a lot was Black Ops 2. After that and up until now I bought 1 more game, and received another one for free and neither of them I played longer than 2 hours. That means that for 12 years I have been kind of disconnected with the franchise. I played some Warzone a couple of years ago, but that‚Äôs about it.\n\nWhen Black Ops 6 came closer to launch, it got on my radar and actually looked kind of fun. A lot less jetpack and wall running, and it promised to go back to the good old days of Black ops 1 & 2. I decided to wait until the reviews came out, and they were rather positive, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the campaign. Even back in the days when I was still playing Black Ops 1 and 2, I never really touched the campaign in COD games. The only campaign I only ever finished before was Modern Warfare 2(2009). Others I played for a couple of missions but always lost interest rather quickly. Maybe because I was younger as well. I must say I really enjoyed the Black Ops 6 campaign! It looks impressive graphically, and the environments are really detailed. The story itself wasn‚Äôt the most interesting, but the mix of action, large battles, spy missions and zombies, together with the sound design and detailed environments kept me hooked.\n\nNext, the zombie mode. I‚Äôm really enjoying this as well in co-op with a friend. It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs only 2 levels, but they‚Äôre both solid maps. There‚Äôs a ton of Easter eggs to discover if you like, which can definitely help you get further, but in contrast to some of the zombie modes in recent COD games, here I don‚Äôt have the feeling you actually need to know the Easter eggs in order to have fun. All in all, it‚Äôs solid. It could use an extra map for sure though.\n\nThen multiplayer. Again, it‚Äôs solid. It‚Äôs what you expect of an average COD game. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs more boots on the ground than recent years, and it runs smoothly. It has everything you know and love. Solid maps, A good variety of weapons, Perks, Score streaks, Leveling etc. etc. The only real downside here for me is the map size. The maps are fun, but all of them are on the small side. It really lacks some medium-sized maps. Due to the current map size there is little room for gameplay variety, and you‚Äôre almost forced to go the run and gun route.\n\nThere is one thing I really need to complain about though. Why the hell did they choose to go the route of bundling multiple COD games into 1 launcher. It makes for an unbelievably bad experience. The UI in the main menus but also in the rest of the game(s) is laggy. and the cycle for when an update is launched is so annoying. Here is a typical flow of starting the campaign after a update:\n\n-Steam downloads a update for Call of Duty\n-You start the game, which starts the COD Hub.\n-The game notifies you a update is installed and needs to be restarted\n-You restart the game\n-You again start the game, which starts the COD Hub again\n-You click on Campaign\n-The game closes and starts the Campaign instance.\n\nWho thought this was a good idea? Not to mention that because everything is merged into one hub, in my library and on my Steam Profile I am missing Call of Duty Black Ops 6. Meaning I cannot go to the store page from my library, and cannot see my individual hours played for a specific Call of Duty game. It‚Äôs a really bad system in the way it is now. Not only this, but the COD Hub is bloated. Advertisements for microtransactions and other (not owned) games everywhere. Why do I pay 80 euros and get a launcher full of bloatware, microtransactions and laggy menus?!\n\nOverall though, it's a blast to play a good Call of Duty game again. It‚Äôs a bit barebone in content with only 2 zombie maps, a 7-hour campaign and only small multiplayer maps, but the overall package is still solid. The COD Hub is incredibly bad though, it‚Äôs a turd on the otherwise good experience of playing this game.",

            "review": "Same old song and dance with the yearly release of Call of Duty except you always need an internet connection to play because of texture streaming which has caused multiplayer and zombies to become stutter fests whenever I have any other application open. The gameplay does feel much better than MWII 2022, but the instant slide with a huge speed boost makes engagements more annoying than ever. Multiplayer feels like your normal CoD experience with the new movement systems, but feels somewhat clunky with hits seemingly not registering at times (explained later) as well as hackers already being present due to the reusing of the same engine/code as previous years and the SBMM feeling as garbage as usual. Zombies is fun and I'm somewhat hopefully for the future of it as a long time fan and enjoyer of Cold War. However, the constant internet connection needed for SOLO games causes those to feel wrong with damage taking a moment to register as it has to verify it with the server. This necessary verification can cause: shots not to register, players to teleport around, and overall create a gameplay experience that does not feel quite right after some time playing. This same thing is present in multiplayer as well, but is more understandable since that is an actual multiplayer environment though it does not feel good there as feel with shots not registering and the game telling you how many shots the opponent hit on you but not how much you hit on them. Campaign is a fun experience, but most players are going to gloss over it after seeing a playthrough elsewhere or after their first time through.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this and wish I didn't fall into the hype behind it. I can't see the series going in any other direction other than the one they are going in now and don't plan on continuing the vicious cycle of the yearly CoD cycle. I think I'm done after this one.",

The campaign was good, but at this point the story has wrapped up enough that for future games their is no point in bothering anymore. Zombies is the only real worthwhile aspect of this game, and even that doesn't justify the price tag and dog shit predatory practices CoD has morphed into over the years.",

The game's setting is a mysterious research facility, and you play as Chell, a test subject who's been awakened from stasis to find that the facility has been overrun by decay and neglect.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a blend of physics-based puzzles and platforming, with a variety of challenges that will test your problem-solving skills and reflexes. You'll need to use the portal gun to create portals on surfaces, allowing you to teleport between them and manipulate the environment to your advantage. But that's just the beginning - the game introduces new mechanics such as gels that can change the properties of surfaces, and lasers that can be redirected and focused.\r\n\r\nBut Portal 2 isn't just about solving puzzles. The game's witty humor and deep narrative are also highlights, with a memorable cast of characters including Wheatley, a personality core with a mind of his own, and GLaDOS, the malevolent AI from the first game. The game's story is more fleshed out than the first, with a surprising twist that will leave you questioning the nature of reality.\r\n\r\nAnd for those who enjoy a more challenging experience, the game's difficulty curve is steep, with tough puzzles that will test your skills as a gamer.\r\n\r\nThe game's physics engine is also a highlight, with realistic physics and environmental interactions that make every encounter feel unique. You can use the game's physics to your advantage, such as using portals to redirect lasers or manipulate momentum.\r\n\r\nSo if you're a fan of puzzle-platformers and want a mind-bending adventure that takes everything that made the first game great and expands upon it, then Portal 2 is the game for you. With its vibrant and colorful environment, challenging gameplay, and engaging story, this game is a must-play for any fan of the genre.
